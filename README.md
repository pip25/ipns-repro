A simple project for reproducing [this libp2p issue](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/6108).

The application takes a CID as a command line argument. For example, the CID of the _it_works.txt_ file here is "_QmRir6d4XmC4sEBVahZ5WJQA2WgftNnE8rauqqgVoQLBBS_". 
It connects to the main IPFS DHT (using the same bootstrap nodes as the latest Kubo version) and after establishing a confirmed external node address and waiting
for the DHT bootstrap (until _num_remaining_ reaches zero), it creates an IPNS record using its own autogenerated identity key and tries publishing it to the DHT
with a quorum parameter of _one_. 

The publishing process, to my best knowledge, always fails, as regardless of quorum value zero successes are reported.

**NOTE:** If you are behind a NAT, create a port forward rule for port 5500, otherwise the AutoNAT won't be able to confirm an external address
for the application and it will keep running indefinitely.
